# Setting Up Qt for BLE GATT Server Development

This document outlines the steps to install Qt and the necessary components to develop Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) GATT server applications. These server applications, running on desktop or mobile platforms, can then communicate with an ESP32 acting as a BLE GATT client.

## 1. Qt Installation

The recommended way to install Qt is using the Qt Online Installer.

### Steps:
1.  **Download Qt Online Installer**:
    *   Go to the official Qt website: [qt.io](https://www.qt.io/)
    *   Navigate to the "Download" section. You might need to create a Qt Account if you don't have one.
    *   Download the Qt Online Installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

2.  **Run the Installer**:
    *   Execute the downloaded installer.
    *   Log in with your Qt Account.
    *   **Choose Installation Folder**: Select a directory for your Qt installation.
    *   **Select Components**: This is a crucial step.
        *   **Qt Version**: Select the latest stable Qt version (e.g., Qt 6.x.x).
        *   **Modules**:
            *   Under the selected Qt version, ensure you select the **"Qt Bluetooth"** module. This is essential for BLE development.
            *   You may also want other common modules like "Qt Core", "Qt GUI", "Qt Widgets", "Qt QML" (if you plan to use QML for UI).
        *   **Development Tools**:
            *   **Qt Creator**: This is Qt's integrated development environment (IDE) and is highly recommended. It's usually selected by default.
            *   **Compilers**: The installer will typically suggest appropriate compilers for your system (e.g., MinGW on Windows, or it will prompt you to have MSVC, GCC, or Clang installed). For mobile development:
                *   **Android**: Ensure you select the necessary Android components (e.g., "Android ARMv7", "Android ARM64v8", "Android x86_64"). You will also need the Android SDK and NDK installed separately (Qt Creator can help manage these later).
                *   **iOS**: (On macOS) Qt will use Xcode and the iOS SDK, which need to be installed separately.
        *   **Target Platforms**: Ensure you select components for the desktop platform you are on (e.g., "Desktop MSVC 2019 64-bit" or "Desktop GCC 64-bit"). If you plan mobile development, select the Android/iOS targets.

3.  **Agree to Licenses and Install**:
    *   Review and accept the license agreements.
    *   Proceed with the installation. This might take some time depending on the selected components and internet speed.

## 2. Qt Creator IDE

Qt Creator is the primary IDE for Qt development and is typically installed with Qt.
*   It provides tools for code editing, project management, building, debugging, and UI design (Qt Designer).
*   When you create a new Qt project, Qt Creator will help you set up "Kits" which define the Qt version, compiler, and debugger for your target platform(s).

## 3. Developing a BLE GATT Server

With Qt and the Qt Bluetooth module installed, you can create a GATT server.

*   **Key Qt Bluetooth Classes for GATT Server**:
    *   `QLowEnergyController`: Used in peripheral mode to manage advertising and connections.
    *   `QLowEnergyServiceData`: To define your custom GATT services.
    *   `QLowEnergyCharacteristicData`: To define the characteristics within your services, including their UUIDs, properties (read, write, notify, indicate), and initial values.
    *   `QLowEnergyDescriptorData`: To define descriptors for characteristics (e.g., Client Characteristic Configuration Descriptor - CCCD for notifications/indications).
    *   `QLowEnergyAdvertisingData`: To configure the advertisement packet, including the local name of your server and the UUIDs of the services it offers.
    *   `QLowEnergyService`: Represents a service on the peripheral once it's running.

*   **Workflow**:
    1.  Define your custom service and characteristic UUIDs (these must match what your ESP32 client will be looking for).
    2.  Create `QLowEnergyCharacteristicData` objects for each characteristic.
    3.  Create a `QLowEnergyServiceData` object and add your characteristics to it.
    4.  Initialize `QLowEnergyController` in peripheral mode.
    5.  Start advertising the service using `QLowEnergyController::startAdvertising()` with appropriate `QLowEnergyAdvertisingParameters` and `QLowEnergyAdvertisingData`.
    6.  Handle incoming connections and read/write/notification requests from clients (like your ESP32).

## 4. ESP32 Communication

*   Your Qt application will act as the GATT Server.
*   Your ESP32 application will act as the GATT Client.
*   The ESP32 will scan for BLE devices, find your Qt server (by its advertised name or service UUID), connect to it, discover its services and characteristics, and then read, write, or subscribe to notifications/indications.

## 5. Platform-Specific Considerations for Mobile

*   **Android**:
    *   You'll need the **Android SDK** and **Android NDK**. Qt Creator can help you configure paths to these tools (Tools > Options > Devices > Android).
    *   You'll need to manage Android permissions for Bluetooth in your app's `AndroidManifest.xml` file (e.g., `BLUETOOTH`, `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`, `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`).
*   **iOS**:
    *   You'll need **Xcode** installed on a macOS machine.
    *   You'll need to configure Bluetooth permissions in your app's `Info.plist` file (e.g., `NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription`, `NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription`).

## 6. VS Code for Qt Development (Optional)

While Qt Creator is the standard, you can also use Visual Studio Code for Qt development, especially if your project uses CMake.
*   **Extensions**:
    *   **CMake Tools**: For configuring, building, and debugging CMake-based Qt projects.
    *   **C/C++ Extension Pack** (from Microsoft): For C++ language support.
*   **Setup**: You would create a `CMakeLists.txt` file for your Qt project. The CMake Tools extension would then use this to build your application. You'd need to ensure CMake can find your Qt installation (e.g., by setting `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`).

## Next Steps
*   Explore the Qt Bluetooth examples provided with your Qt installation (usually found in the "Examples" section of Qt Creator or in your Qt installation directory). The "Heart Rate Server" or "Bluetooth Low Energy Peripheral" examples can be good starting points.
*   Consult the official Qt Bluetooth documentation for detailed API references.

This setup will provide a robust environment for creating BLE GATT server applications on various platforms to interact with your ESP32 devices.
